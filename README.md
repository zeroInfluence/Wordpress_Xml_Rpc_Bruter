Wordpress_Xml_Rpc_Bruter
========================

To Bruteforce Password For Admin Account through Xml Rpc Interface Wordpress

this tool has very little error checking and was more of a poc for myself to try out

if you guys like it modify it anyway you like thread it out etc i left it as is as i believe 

it will cause less suspiscion if its throttled like that from the get go although i did have it going at about 2,000 requests per minute but i scrapped that as it would be very easy to use maliciously 

it is used like this

username may or may not be admin i suggest wpscan to determine valid admin account

blogpath such as blog,wordpress,w0rdpr3ss etc

url http://localhost/ enter the path and url as shown when program loads dont add or subtract slashes
just modify your url as i said very basic
